## General info
I have created a web application that serves both managers and employees, provides easy access and at the same time keeps personal and company data confidential.
The application distinguishes between two user types:


* Administrator (Admin) - the company manager, administrator
* User - employee, worker

Allows management to invite users to the system and manage them. The application also allows them to manage leave requests from employees in a clean and easy-to-use interface. 
Employees are invited into the system by invitation, filtering out unwanted intruders. Once registered, the application allows them to request leave through a simple interface. At the same time, they can track the status of their requests, saving them further effort. 
Both user types have a profile where they can enter informative data. But more importantly, they can also manage their security settings, such as password change, session management or even two-step login.
